        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        After the pandemic, more and more employees work from home. They appear
        in offices only on selected days or only to integrate with the team.
        Since there is no longer such a demand for office space, companies
        decide to cut costs and reduce them. Employees in such a situation do
        not know if they will find a place to work when they come to the office
        because usually there are fewer places to work than employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Possible Solution</h3>
        An application that allows employees to book a desk in the office for a
        specific day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Project Goal</h3>
        My goal is to design screens for MVP of the new application for desk
        booking, taking into consideration observed good practises and problems
        in an audit of the Odra app (Monterail company desk booking app). The
        new application will no longer be associated with the Monterail brand,
        it will be a separate platform and will be dedicated to companies that
        need a desk booking system. I will try to repeat good practises and
        avoid mistakes observed during an audit of the Odra app and based on the
        research (UX Audit, Competitive analysis, and Interviews with users) I
        will decide what features should be included in the MVP of the desk
        booking app.

        <h3>UX Audit</h3>
        Odra app is Monterail company desk booking app. I was using it for a
        year when I was working in Monterail company. When I have participated
        in the recruitment process for Monterail company, as a recruitment task,
        I was supposed to perform a short UX audit of Odra app and design a
        solution to one of the observed problems.
        <br />
        For this project I have decided to conduct full UX Audit of this app (I
        have learned a lot during this year and now I wanted to make the audit
        one more time in a more proper way). When designing my application, I
        have tried to avoid errors and repeat good practises that I found while
        auditing the Odra app. For the UX Audit of the Odra App, I have decided
        to use the Cognitive walkthrough method. I distinguished the following 4
        flows from the application:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating a new booking</li>
          <li>Checking booking history</li>
          <li>Going to My reservations</li>
          <li>Editing an existing booking</li>
        </ul>
        Based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, I went through each
        flow and assessed each screen separately as well as entire paths in
        terms of their logic and consistency. During the evaluation I used a
        5-point error rating scale, its legend is below:
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_1} alt="deskly_1" style={{ maxWidth: "564px" }} />
      <p>Below an example of one screen from my audit.</p>

        Click here to see full audit in Figma file
      </a>
      <p>
        To sum up the audit of the Odra app I have chosen good practices which I
        would like to repeat when designing my app. I have also chosen the
        biggest mistakes from the Odra app and wrote advice for myself about
        what I should remember to not repeat those mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were many good practices that I observed in the Odra application.
        I will describe two of them below.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first step in the process of booking the desk is choosing the
            date for which we want to make a booking. When we move to the next
            steps, we can still see this date on the screen. This is in line
            with the 6th rule of Usability Heuristics - "Recognition Rather than
            Recall" which tells us that we shouldn't force users to remember
            elements, actions, and options but make them visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can also change this date during any step. This is in line
            with the 3rd rule of Usability Heuristics - "User Control and
            Freedom" which says that users make mistakes often and we should
            design easy ways to fix them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have found many mistakes in the Odra app. I will mention two of them.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The process of desk booking has been divided into a lot of steps,
            which makes it complicated and long.
          </li>
          <li>
            The app is not accessible. The contrast between the text and
            background in the calendar viiew is too low. There are some elements
            e.g. chevrons that are so small that are almost unnoticeable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Competitor analysis</h3>I have made the competitors analysis to see
        what features other desk bookking apps offear and what are their
        strenghts and weaknesses.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_3} alt="deskly_3" />
      <p>
        <h3>In-depth interviews</h3>I have conducted interviews with 4 users of
        a desk booking systems. Using the past or current desk booking app was
        the only criterion that I used while looking for participants for this
        interview. Through the interviews, I wanted to find out how users make
        reservations, what habits they have related to this activity, and what
        features applications they use are offering. I wanted to know also what
        is important for them in the process of booking a desk and what features
        in desk booking apps are important for them and which are useless. As I
        wanted to get precise answers from users I was asking about their last
        experience with booking the desk. I have gained many insights from
        interviews. I will mention two of them:
        <ul>
          <li>
            There was no possibility of booking rooms in any of the applications
            used by users, but all users agreed that it would be a useful and
            helpful feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            All users missed in the application they use an interactive map on
            which they could see the entire floor and be able to click on a
            specific place, and simply book it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>MVP features</h3>
        After the research phase, I have decided what features, I will include
        in the MVP version of my application. Below are features that I chose
        for MVP and an explanation of why I chose them:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Being able to book a desk for a specific day by use of an
            interactive map - I chose this feature as all users in in-depth
            interviews agreed that they miss this feature in apps they use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being able to cancel reservations - As I mentioned earlier according
            to the 3rd rule of Usability Heuristics - "User Control and Freedom"
            users make mistakes often and we should design easy ways to fix
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being able to see who is sitting where on the map - I chose this
            feature as being able to see where favorite co-workers are sitting
            was an aspect mentioned by all users in interviews as an aspect
            taken into consideration when deciding where to book the desk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being able to see current reservations - I chose this feature as
            according to the 6th rule of Usability Heuristics - "Recognition
            Rather than Recall" we shouldn't force users to remember information
            like this but rather make it visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web app accessible on desktops - I decided that the application in
            the MVP version will be a web app accessible only on desktops. I
            have made this decision as users during in-depth interviews said
            that it would be nice to have a mobile app but it is not the
            must-have for them as they are making bookings during work while
            using the laptop, so probably even if they would have a mobile app,
            they would use a desktop version in most of the cases.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Proto-Personas</h3>
        To better understand who the users of my application will be and to be
        able to identify with them more during the design phase, I decided to
        create Proto-personas. I call them Proto-personas because they are based
        on my hypotheses and interviews with users of other desk booking
        applications.
        <br />
        My Proto-persons will need validation with the market and confirmation
        of the assumptions after the application release.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created two Proto-personas because I wanted to create a representative
        of the direct client of my application - company owners who need a desk
        booking system, and an indirect client - employees of these companies
        who will use my application.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        To better organise the content and flow of my application and to
        understand what screens I need to design I have created Information
        Architecture.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_5} alt="deskly_5" style={{ maxWidth: "759px" }} />
      <p>
        <h3>User flow</h3>
        To understand better what flows I need to cover I have created user
        flow.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_6} alt="deskly_6" />
      <p>
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        My next step was to prepare quick sketches with my ideas for screens
        that I needed.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_7} alt="deskly_7" />
      <p>
        <h3>Final UI</h3>
        Then I transferred my ideas to Figma and below you can see few screens
        with final UI.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_8} alt="deskly_8" />
      <p>
        <h3>Design System</h3>
        To speed up work on the project, I used components available in free
        source design systems. It was very important to me that all elements
        were consistent with each other.
      </p>
      <img src={deskly_9} alt="deskly_9" />
      <p>
        <h3>What next?</h3>
        My next step will be to conduct usability tests with users to check if
        the application is user-friendly. Then I will summarize the test results
        and based on them I will improve wireframes.
